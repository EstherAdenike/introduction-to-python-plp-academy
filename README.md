# Basic Calculator Program

This is a simple command-line calculator written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — between two numbers.

## Features

- Accepts user input for two numbers
- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Handles division by zero errors
- Provides user-friendly output

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. Choose a mathematical operation from the following:
   - `+` for addition
   - `-` for subtraction
   - `*` for multiplication
   - `/` for division
5. View the result or an error message (e.g., if division by zero or invalid operator).

## Example

```

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, \*, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Notes

- Only basic arithmetic is supported.
- The program performs one operation at a time.
- Invalid input or operator will return a helpful message.
